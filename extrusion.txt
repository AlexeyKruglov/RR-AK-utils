PLA:

Pushing filment by hand.

195 flows ok. Some backflow.

188 hard to push it down. Moved to the side of the swollen filament cone.

Conic plug formed, the pushing filament moved to its side and started 
swelling under the load. Doesn't extrude nearly at all.

Cut the `plug'.
188 C -> flows ok, some backflow formed.
192 C -> flows ok, more backflow.
Pushing filament remains soft long after extrusion. Need retract farther or/and drop 
heating or insulate it from the hot air from the hot heating cone..
Seems it was softer inside, so maybe it was due to PLA thermal condustivity during
the extrusion.

190 C. No additional backflow! But hard to push.

190 C. Second try. Cannot extrude at all, plug formed.
Maybe the filament rotated and got stuck before reaching the hottest part, then started
heating slowly (to the lower temps) and swelling, blocking longitudinal motion further.

Probably filament & its swollen cone interior remained (became) warm after the last 
extrusion, and swollen under the load at the start of this extr.

The swollen cone end becomes dull due to PLA surface tension. PLA is rubber-like 
when warm (above some temp? -- filament shaft demonstates sharp boundary between
the rubber-like and solid regions when extrusion gets stuck and filament shaft 
gets warm).

190 C, PLA. No swollen cone, freshly cut filament. Extrusion flow ok, no backflow.
From now on turn extruder heater off completely after extrusion end and retract filament
closer to the cold end (for PLA only, not ABS). Retract 20 mm up = 3 mm between
swollen cone top (nearly no backflow) and the cold end bottom.

190 C. Second try. Harder to push, but possible. Shaft NOT soft (= hard) after 
extrusion end. Cone hardened 101 sec after extrusion end. 

=> Either start next extrusion right after the preceeding (say, < 5 sec), 
or wait >= ~120 sec (extr. heater off) between segments. Underlying theory
at 30.6.2014. Also need to limit extrusion speed from below. Maybe use 
forced ventilation to cool the swollen cone after extrusion..

Estimate extrusion rate. Extrudate width 0.75x0.85 mm (elliptic), 
length 13.5 cm -> cross-section area 0.50 mm^2, volume 68 mm^3,
time=30..40 sec -> rate = 1.93 mm^3/sec.
Filament 2.9x2.9 .. 3.0x3.0 -> S=6.8 mm^2 -> v_in=0.28 mm/sec.

Sec-last time: width 0.7x0.75 mm -> area=0.41 mm^2, length=~10 cm,
time=26 sec. -> volume=41 mm^3, rate=1.58 mm^3/sec. ???: It seemed faster
than the second time (1.93 mm^3/sec).

190 C. 3rd try. Plugged. Swollen cone soft after 20 sec in the heating cone.
No extrusion. Maybe filament rotated?
Sw-cone hard <=100 sec after retraction (heating off only 61 sec after retraction).

220 C, then 190 C. Trying to melt plug. Extruded a little (5.5 sec) at 220 C, 
then no extrusion at 190 C.
Maybe lowered to 190 C too early?

220 C, then 190 C. Trying to melt the plug. 18 sec at 220 C, then 17 sec 
at 190 C. Pushed through at 220 C after applying some force, then steady
extrusion at 220 C and later at 190 C. But filament shaft shifted
to sw-cone side (at center before). Needed higher heater temp for larger 
temp gradient in the sw-cone?

Measuring PLA softening temperature. Heating in the heating cone and checking.
80 C	hard
100	soft (could be softer)
80	hard (after holding for 120 sec at 80 C)
90	hard (after 100 sec)
95	soft, rubber-like (after 100 sec)
93	soft (80 sec)
91	soft a little, incl. the lower end (70 sec)
90	soft, incl lower end (70 sec)
85	hard (80 sec)
85	hard (1900 sec at 85 C)

Air temp about 24.0 (RR thermistor).

Shaft softening theory. T_shaft-T_a = (T_h-T_a)*exp(-t_D / t), 
t=time, t_D = temp. diffusion time for sw-cone. 
We have T_a ~= 30 C, T_sh=T_s = 90 C, T_h=220 C, t_sh.s. = 15..20 sec,
let t_sh.s. = 16 sec  ->  t_D = ~18 sec.

236 C (better 240, but MAXTEMP=240 now, overshoot ~ 1.5 C), start extr, wait 10 sec, 190 C.
Extrusion ok, but hard. Extrusion starts with some delay (maybe 2..5 sec) after 
applying force. Shaft moved a little closer to sw-cone center, no backflow.

240 C, start pushing, wait 10 sec, 190 C. Measuring the delay between pushing and extrision.
Extr started 7 sec after applying force. Some backflow. The required force 
increased after cooling to 190 C.
0.6x0.7 mm at 190 C
0.55x0.65 mm at 240 C

If we assume that sw-cone can be pushed through when some part of it heats
to 150 C (T_a+120 C = T_h-90 C) and it takes 7 sec at 240 C (T_a+210 C), then 
diffusion time t_d for that part is t_d=4 sec.
For 90 C instead of 150 C we get t_d=9 sec.

Maybe cool (to <~150 C) the sw-cone inside the heating cone to avoid forming 
a `beard' below the sw-cone after retraction?

Tried autonomous extrusion initiation: heat to 240 C, wait, move to -0.5, 
extrude at 0.15mm/sec until +1.0 for 10 sec, drop to 190 C, extrude at 0.25 mm/sec.
Initiation seems ok. Maybe move faster like 0.2 mm/sec and extrude at 0.3 mm/sec?

Finish: retract -0.25 at 10 mm/sec, drop to 100 C, wait 25 sec, retract 
to -2 at 0.5 mm/sec, to -20 at 10 mm/sec. Finishing not ok: long 'beard'
of molten plastic under the sw-cone. Better retract fast farther?

27.9.2014
Init: 240 C, wait 40 sec, move to -0.5 at 6.66mm/sec, extr 2 mm at 0.2mm/sec
for 10 sec, drop to 190 C, continue extr at 0.3 mm/sec.
Finish: retract -20 mm at 10 mm/sec.
-> Extr more-or-less ok at 240 C, nearly no flow at 190 C: filament slips
in cold-end.

Second try (fixing some feedrate bugs). Same result: cold-end too weak,
filament slips. But when trying to push it with hand with extr motor on
it holds filament well. Maybe the toothed wheel strips filament during 
initiation or it just IS stripped at that position, i.e. was stripped 
during the previous extrusion tests.

Try to continue extr at 220 C instead of 190 C and see.
-> cold-end cannot push the filament, it slips. After helping with hand,
it managed to push it itself for the last ~3 sec of extrusion (out of 
20 sec at 220 C)

Drop extr speed 0.3 to 0.2 mm/sec at 220 C.
After some initial help by hand it managed to extrude on its own.
Seems like it strips at initial move. Move to -1.25 mm initially
instead of -0.5 mm.

Trying it -> extruded 0.55x0.6x80 mm = 20.7 mm^3 -> ~3 mm of filament
instead of 4.75 mm -> eta~=0.63. 

Second try. Extr 2.7mm of filament (direct measurement). 0.6x0.65x50mm = 
= 15.3 mm^3 -> 2.2mm of filament -> 3 mm^3 into backflow???.

3rd try. Extr 18.3-14.5=3.8mm of filament, 0.6x0.65x101mm=30.9 mm^3 
extrudate, corr. to 4.5mm filament. 5 mm^3 from 'backflow' (i.e. from
decrease in sw-cone volume)? Backflow doesn't seem to build up (i.e. 
grow).

Almost no bubbles at 190 C, some bubbles in extrudate at 220 C and 240 C.
